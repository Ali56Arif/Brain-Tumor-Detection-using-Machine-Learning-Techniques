# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
VGG16 or VGG19: Good for basic image classification tasks.
The Above Dataset file contains the following items:

A CSV file named Brain Tumor.csv
A folder named Brain Tumor
Another CSV file named bt_dataset_t3.csv
These items suggest that the data for brain tumor detection, possibly including image data and related labels or features, is available. Given the presence of CSV files, these might contain metadata, labels, or features extracted from the images in the Brain Tumor folder.

To proceed with "Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning Techniques" using transfer learning models like VGG16 or VGG19, which are indeed well-suited for basic image classification tasks, we would typically follow these steps:

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the images and associated labels for training and testing. This might involve resizing images to match the input dimensions of VGG16 or VGG19 (typically 224x224 pixels), normalizing pixel values, and possibly augmenting the dataset to improve model generalizability.
Model Selection: Choose between VGG16 or VGG19. Both are deep convolutional networks known for their effectiveness in image classification, with VGG19 being slightly deeper with more convolutional layers.
Transfer Learning: Utilize a pre-trained VGG16 or VGG19 model, which has already learned features from a vast image dataset (ImageNet). We can fine-tune this model by replacing the top layers with new ones tailored to our specific task (detecting brain tumors) and training the model on our dataset.
Training: Train the model on the brain tumor dataset, adjusting hyperparameters as needed and monitoring performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set to assess its effectiveness in detecting brain tumors, using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
